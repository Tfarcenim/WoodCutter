# Fabric Example Mod

## Setup

1. Edit build.gradle and mod.json to suit your needs.
    * The "mixins" object can be removed from mod.json if you do not need to use mixins.
    * Please replace all occurences of "modid" with your own mod ID - sometimes, a different string may also suffice.
    
2. Import the `build.gradle` file into IDEA.

3. (optional) run the `genSources` gradle task if you want browsable Minecraft source files.
